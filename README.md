FrontEnd-MeetingRoom
====================

Private iOS 7 app to manage reservations for (meeting/conference) rooms.  Comes with a personal version for quickly reserving a conference room while on the road, checking which reservations you've made in the past, consult the reservations of any room by date.

Also supplied is an iPad only version to be displayed next to the conference room. Beautiful pictures related to the conference room's name and a timer which displays when the room becomes (un)available again. You can consult all future reservations, in agenda view, month view and day view.

This project was part of a 3-week develop sprint in an extended Java/Mobile Apps course. This contains all frontend/ios code. The back-end code, which we also wrote as part of this project can be found here: https://github.com/wim82/Backend-MeetingRoom

Due to time constraints, this app is still quite buggy and contains some really ugly code. We (are/were) beginners. Explore at your own risk! :-)
